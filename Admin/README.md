# Admin Server

This is a private Node.js Express server that hosts the Admin dashboard at `https://admin.[domain]`. It initializes the database, generates the source and client certificates, and other admin actions. Every day at midnight, it creates a snapshot of Partner referrals. Its Security Group restricts its access to one specific whitelisted IP. Most actions are logged and many actions, such as signin or signup, send email alerts to the administrator.
